# Health-Record-Database-System
EPICS Mini Project on Mother Theresa Health Center
The issue of health and hygiene is very important for oneâ€™s well-being. With the recent
surge in typhoid cases inside the campus, we should all strive to maintain health
standards in the college. A key role in this endeavor is being taken up by the Mother
Theresa Health Center . We should all appreciate their round-the-clock ef forts to serve
the needs of the affected. But there is only so much a few college community members
can do. To solve this problem we intend to create a website for the clinic that can
improve communication between the health service providers and the students. On this
website, we intend to regularly post information about basic hygiene maintenance
techniques. Also since the number of patients the clinic is treating is very high, we would like
to imbibe an appointment system into our website so that the clinic can treat patients in
a smooth and efficient manner. Along with this, there will be provision for online
prescriptions and contact details of the clinic staff including the ambulance operators.


The current system adopts a very primitive form of storing records. The appointment records of each student are only registered in a single book that are prone to diminish in quality over time. This is not very good as those records might be needed in the long run

The current system also does not maintain records of the medicines prescribed to the patients. This actually can lead to disputes in funding to the health center and might be a breeding ground to untraceable fraud.

Student rely on the health center to issue medical certificates. But these certificates are handed out as hardcopies. These copies are hard to maintain and students often struggle to produce them at the end of the semester when required.

Traditional offline record maintenance methods have several limitations that can make it difficult for some patients to retrieve their previous health records. One of the main challenges is accessibility. It will be difficult for the health centre to produce these records as the current hard copies will diminish in quality over time. This can create a barrier and will hinder the patients convenience during the health checkup process.
